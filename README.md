# aud_midi_apple

The macOS and iOS backend of aud_midi: CoreMIDI through FFI and a small C
shim, Bluetooth LE MIDI through CoreBluetooth, the network session of iOS
and Bonjour.

Part of the aud_midi family, see [aud_midi](https://github.com/audanika/aud_midi).

## Goals

- CoreMIDI ports, virtual endpoints, hotplug, UMP in both directions
- OS timestamps on input, CoreMIDI scheduling on output
- BLE MIDI via CoreBluetooth and the CoreMIDI Bluetooth driver
- `MIDINetworkSession` on iOS, Bonjour browsing and advertising
- Small C shim copies packets off CoreMIDI threads

## State

`AppleMidiBackend` (name `coremidi`) implements `MidiBackend` of
[aud_midi_core](https://github.com/audanika/aud_midi_core):

- Ports: every CoreMIDI source is an input, every destination an output,
  including the virtual endpoints of other apps and offline devices
  (`MidiPortState.offline`, so a re-plugged device keeps its port ids).
  Ids are `coremidi:<unique id>`; ports are grouped device → entity →
  endpoint with `index`; the transport comes from the driver (USB,
  Bluetooth, network, IAC bus = software, none = virtual); UMP groups
  come from `kMIDIPropertyUMPActiveGroupBitmap`.
- I/O: all ports exchange UMP words in the protocol of their endpoint.
  Each source is connected to the MIDI 1.0 or the MIDI 2.0 input port
  that matches its protocol, so CoreMIDI never translates. Inputs carry
  the CoreMIDI timestamps on the package clock; future packets go to the
  CoreMIDI scheduler. No port reports `cancelPending`: the backend never
  calls `MIDIFlushOutput` (see below), so the engine cancels only its own
  software queue, and packets already handed to CoreMIDI are sent.
- Virtual ports (`virtualPorts` is the backend): sources and destinations
  with protocol, unique id, manufacturer, model and groups.
- Hotplug: CoreMIDI notifications → re-enumeration → added, removed and
  changed ports; an open input reconnects when its source comes back.
- Bluetooth (macOS 13, iOS 16): scan for the BLE-MIDI service, connect,
  `MIDIBluetoothDriverActivateAllConnections`, wait for the CoreMIDI
  device, end the CoreBluetooth connection.
- Network: `MIDINetworkSession` on iOS; `browse()` through DNS-SD;
  `MidiBonjourAdvertiser` implements `MidiServiceAdvertiser`.

Verified on macOS 27 (Apple silicon) with real CoreMIDI, no mocks:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Virtual source → input port, MIDI 1.0 and 2.0, SysEx7/8 across packets | words and order unchanged, timestamps exact (0 µs) |
| Output port → virtual destination | words unchanged |
| Scheduled send, 50 notes 10 ms apart, 100 ms ahead | 12–57 µs late over two runs, medians 26 and 30 µs |
| `cancelPending` | no System Reset; the scheduled note still arrives |
| `MIDIFlushOutput` on a virtual destination | System Reset delivered (the reason for the rule above) |
| Hotplug of virtual endpoints | events after about 310–330 ms |
| `stop()` while a burst is in flight | no crash, nothing delivered afterwards |
| Bonjour | register, browse, resolve and lose a service |
| Build hook | dylib for macOS arm64/x64, iOS device and simulator; nothing elsewhere |

Run for real on the iOS 26.2 simulator (iPhone 17 Pro) by a throwaway
Flutter app that depends on the package:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Virtual source → input port, MIDI 2.0 with SysEx8 | words unchanged, timestamps exact |
| Scheduled send, 30 notes 10 ms apart | 6–45 µs late, median 11–20 µs |
| `MIDINetworkSession` | enable, change notifications, session ports, Bonjour sees the session, connect, disconnect, state restored |
| CoreBluetooth | central opens, reports "unsupported" (no Bluetooth in the simulator), scan ends empty |

Not verified: a real BLE-MIDI peripheral (none here; in `dart test` a
`CBCentralManager` aborts the process for lack of a Bluetooth usage
description) and a network session with a real peer. Their logic is
tested with fakes.

Findings that shape the behaviour:

- On iOS the session's `networkName` is nil until the MIDI server set
  the session up, although the SDK declares it non-null, and its port
  follows shortly after enabling; the backend reads both tolerantly.
- `MIDINetworkSession` does nothing on macOS: `defaultSession` is nil.
  There `network` is null; macOS sessions are set up in Audio MIDI Setup
  and appear as ports, and the package's own AppleMIDI can be announced
  with `MidiBonjourAdvertiser`.
- `MIDIFlushOutput(destination)` delivers a System Reset (`0xFF`, as
  UMP `0x10ff0000` for MIDI 1.0 and 2.0) to a virtual destination: always,
  also when nothing was pending, the destination never received anything
  or another process flushed it. A synthesizer app would reset at every
  cancel, so no port supports `cancelPending`. No driver-owned destination
  was online here (IAC bus off, devices unplugged, no network session) and
  none was enabled, so driver destinations follow the same rule.
  `MIDIFlushOutput(0)` drops pending packets without a reset, but for all
  destinations at once.
- CoreMIDI notifications arrive only on the run loop of the thread that
  created the client, about 300 ms after the change; the shim runs that
  run loop itself.
- `MIDIUMPEndpointManager` (macOS 15, iOS 18) may only be used on the
  main thread and did not list the UMP endpoints of other processes in a
  command-line process; `endpoint` and `functionBlocks` stay empty.
- `MIDIDestinationCreateWithProtocol` aborts the process for protocols
  other than 1 and 2; the shim refuses them.

## Installation

```bash
dart pub add aud_midi_apple
```

iOS apps declare in `Info.plist`: `UIBackgroundModes` with `audio`
(virtual endpoints) and `bluetooth-central` (Bluetooth in the background),
`NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`, `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and
`NSBonjourServices` with `_apple-midi._udp`. Sandboxed macOS apps need the
entitlements `com.apple.security.device.bluetooth`,
`com.apple.security.network.client` and
`com.apple.security.network.server`.

## Code Examples

```dart
import 'package:aud_midi_apple/aud_midi_apple.dart';
import 'package:aud_midi_core/aud_midi_core.dart';
import 'package:aud_midi_standard/aud_midi_standard.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final backend = AppleMidiBackend();
  await backend.start(_PrintingHost());

  for (final port in backend.ports.where((port) => port.isInput)) {
    await backend.openPort(port.id);
  }

  final source = await backend.create(
    MidiVirtualPortSpec(
      name: 'aud_midi_apple example',
      direction: MidiDirection.output,
      protocol: MidiProtocol.midi2,
    ),
  );
  const clock = MidiSystemClock();
  await backend.send(
    source.id,
    MidiUmpPacket(words: const [0x40903c00, 0xc8000000], time: clock.now()),
  );
  await backend.stop();
}

final class _PrintingHost implements MidiBackendHost {
  @override
  final MidiClock clock = const MidiSystemClock();

  @override
  void portsChanged(List<MidiPortEvent> events) => events.forEach(print);

  @override
  void received(MidiPortId port, MidiPacket packet) => print('$port $packet');

  @override
  void diagnostic(MidiDiagnostic diagnostic) => print(diagnostic);
}
```

## How It Works

```text
MIDI isolate                     │ native threads
AppleMidiBackend (logic)         │
 ├─ MidiCoreMidi ── FFI ─────────┼─ C shim: run loop thread with all
 │   (ffigen C bindings)         │  clients, receive blocks → ring buffer
 │                               │  → NativeCallable.listener signal
 ├─ MidiAppleBluetoothBackend    │
 │   └─ MidiCoreBluetooth ── ObjC bindings ── CBCentralManager (queue)
 └─ MidiAppleNetworkBackend      │
     ├─ MidiAppleNetworkSession ── ObjC bindings ── MIDINetworkSession
     └─ MidiBonjourBrowser ─ FFI ─┼─ C shim: DNS-SD on a dispatch queue
```

- `src/aud_midi_apple.c` owns one CFRunLoop thread on which it creates
  every MIDI client, because CoreMIDI posts notifications to the run loop
  of the creating thread, and a Dart process has none. It keeps a client
  that is never disposed, since disposing the last client may end the
  connection to the MIDI server.
- Two input ports per client (MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0). The receive block
  copies each `MIDIEventPacket` with the source's ref con, timestamp and
  arrival time into a ring buffer and signals Dart; the consumer side is
  lock-free, producers serialise on an `os_unfair_lock`. Overflow drops
  the newest event list and counts it as a `queueOverflow` diagnostic.
- `stop()` disconnects and disposes, then the shim marks the client
  closed and waits until no callback is in flight before Dart closes the
  `NativeCallable`.
- Mach ticks become microseconds (`mach_timebase_info`) and then the
  package clock through `MidiClockMapper`, resynced every 10 s and on
  hotplug.
- The pure-Dart logic talks to the native layer only through
  `MidiCoreMidi`, `MidiCoreBluetooth`, `MidiAppleNetworkSession` and
  `MidiBonjourBrowser`; the tests replace them by fakes. The native
  implementations are tested against the real system on macOS.
- `hook/build.dart` compiles the shim and the Objective-C trampolines
  generated by ffigen with `native_toolchain_c` for macOS and iOS and does
  nothing on other systems. CoreBluetooth is loaded at runtime, not
  linked.

Regenerate the bindings after changing the shim or the configurations
(ffigen 23 still reads YAML, which it deprecates):

```bash
dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml       # CoreMIDI, CoreFoundation, shim
dart run ffigen --config ffigen_objc.yaml  # CoreBluetooth, MIDINetworkSession
```

Tests that change the global network session only run with
`AUD_MIDI_TEST_NETWORK=1`; `AUD_MIDI_REPORT=<file>` writes the measured
loopback timings as JSON.
